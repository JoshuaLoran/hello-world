# First Project

***This project is the first I am putting online. Hopefully it will be the first of many Micro-controller based projects. I'm pretty new to programming but I understand some concepts and have taken an intro to programming course, which was 1 quater of intro java at a community college. Any help with making my code more efficient or simpler is MUCH appreciated but, PLEASE explain your changes simply.
  I'm looking forward to becoming part of the GitHub community**
